The food industry was shaken as people began hoarding products like pasta, toilet paper or rice. Due to restaurants and cafes closing in many countries, people were not able to go out for dinner or grab a coffee anymore. Lots of people began experimenting more in the kitchen and doubtless, huge amounts of banana bread were being produced. This interactive web map aims to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on interests in food and other essential items in three European countries based on Google Trends data of specific products. Enjoy exploring and comparing across foods, countries & time."
